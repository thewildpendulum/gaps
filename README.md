generator-angular-phonegap-seed
=====================
A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for getting started with [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) (with routing!). Takes you from zero to a barebones Angular app in seconds.


## Dependencies

This generator assumes you have a PhoneGap project ready to go. If not, [PhoneGap-CLI](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-cli) is a great place to start.

Projects are created using the latest version of the unstable branch from [Angular's nightly builds](http://ci.angularjs.org/job/angular.js-angular-master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/).

## Usage

**Install the generator:**

```
$ npm install -g generator-angular-phonegap-seed
```
**Navigate to your previously created PhoneGap project:**

```
$ cd myAwesomeMobileApp
```

**Initiate the generator:**

```
$ yo angular-phonegap-seed
```

**Run the app on your platform of choice:**

```
$ phonegap run ios
```


## Directory structure:

*Note: On Angular 1.2, the routing service has been removed from core. It must be included explicitly.*

```
/www
    /css
        - index.css
    /img
        - logo.png
    /js
        - app.js
        - controllers.js
        - index.js
        - services.js
    /lib
        - angular.js
        - angular-route.js
    /partials
        - main.html
        - view.html
    /res
        // app and cordova images
    /spec
        // tests
```

Build and run your project, and you should be good to go.
